    * src/wav.c src/aiff.c
    Added call to ferror () in main header parsing loop of __XXX_open_read
    functions. This should fix problems on platforms (MacOS, AmigaOS) where 
    fseek()ing or fread()ing beyond the end of the file puts the FILE*
    stream in an error state until clearerr() is called.
    
    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for RAW header-less PCM files.
    
    * src/common.h
    Moved definition of struct tribyte to pcm.c which is the only place
    which needs it.

    * src/pcm.c
    Modified all code which assumed sizeof (struct tribyte) == 3. This code
    did not work on MacOS. Thanks to Ben "Jacobs" for pointing this out.

    * src/au.c
    Removed <sys/stat.h> from list of #includes (not being used).
    
    * src/sndfile.c
    Added MacOS specific #ifdef to replace <sys/stat.h>.
    
    * src/sndfile.h
    Added MacOS specific #ifdef to replace <sys/stat.h>.
    
    * src/sndfile.h
    Added MacOS specific typedef for off_t.
    
    * MacOS-readme.txt
    New file with instructions for building libsndfile under MacOS. Thanks
    to Ben "Jacobs" for supplying these instructions.
    
1999-07-24  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * configure.in
    Removed sndfile.h from generated file list as there were no longer
    any autoconf substitutions being made.
    
    * src/raw.c
    New file for handling raw header-less PCM files. In order to open these
    for read, the user must specify format, pcmbitwidth and channels in the
    SF_INFO struct when calling sf_open_read ().
    
    * src/sndfile.c
    Added support for raw header-less PCM files.    
    
1999-07-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * examples/sfinfo.c
    Removed options so the sfinfo program always prints out all the information.
    
1999-07-19  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/alaw.c
    New file for A-law encoding (similar to u-law).

    players.
    
    * tests/adpcm_test.c
    Reimplemented adpcm_test_short and implemented adpcm_test_int and adpcm_test_double.
    Now have full testing of IMA ADPCM WAV file read, write and seek.

1999-06-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

1999-06-11    Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * configure.in
    Changed to reflect previous changes.
    
    * src/wav_ima_adpcm.c

    to write test code for this.
    
    Fixed bug in __ima_write () whereby the length of the current block was 
    calculated incorrectly. Thanks to Jongcheon Park for pointing this out.

1999-03-27  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/*.c
    Changed all read/write/lseek function calls to fread/fwrite/
    fseek/ftell and added error checking of return values from
    fread and fwrite in critical areas of the code.
    
    * src/au.c
    Fixed incorrect datasize element in AU header on write.
    
    * tests/error_test.c

    string. This will avoid embarrassing real world core dumps.

1999-03-23  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav.c src/aiff.c
    Added handling for unknown chunk markers in the file. 

1999-03-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Filled in missing error strings in SndfileErrors array. Missing entries 
    can cause core dumps when calling sf_error-str (). Thanks to Sam 
    <mrsam at-sign geocities.com> for finding this problem.

1999-03-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav_ima_adpcm.c
    Work on wav_ms_adpcm.c uncovered a bug in __ima_read () when reading 
    stereo files. Caused by not adjusting offset into buffer of decoded
    samples for 2 channels. A similar bug existed in __ima_write ().
    Need a test for stereo ADPCM files.
    
    * src/wav_ms_adpcm.c
    Decoder working correctly.

    <mrsam at-sign geocities.com>.
    
    * src/wav_ima_adpcm.c
    Fixed bug when reading beyond end of data section due to not
    checking pima->blockcount.
    This uncovered __ima_seek () bug due to pima->blockcount being set 
    before calling __ima_init_block ().

1999-03-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav.c
    Started implementing MS ADPCM decoder. 
    If file is WAVE_FORMAT_ADPCM and length of data chunk is odd, this
    encoder seems to add an extra byte. Why not just give an even data
    length? 

1999-03-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/wav.c
    Split code out of wav.c to create wav_float.c and wav_ima_adpcm.c.

    incorrect read count when reading past end of file.
    Fixed bug in sf_seek () when seeking backwards from end of file.

    * test/read_seek_test.c
    Added multiple read test to short_test(), int_test () and
    double_test ().
    Added extra chunk to all test WAV files to test that reading
    stops at end of 'data' chunk.

1999-02-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for little DEC endian AU files.

    * src/au.c
    Add handling for DEC format little endian AU files.
     
1999-02-20  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/aiff.c src/au.c src/wav.c
    Add __psf_sprintf calls during header parsing.
     
    * src/sndfile.c src/common.c

1999-02-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/pcm.c:
    Fixed bug in let2s_array (cptr was not being initialised).

    * src/sndfile.c:
    Fixed bug in sf_read_raw and sf_write_raw. sf_seek should
    now work when using these functions.

1999-02-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * tests/write_read_test.c:
    Force test_buffer array to be double aligned. Sparc Solaris
    requires this.

1999-02-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/pcm.c:
    Fixed a bug which was causing errors in the reading
    and writing of 24 bit PCM files.
    
    * doc/api.html
    Finished of preliminary documentaion.

1999-02-13  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd@zip.com.au>

    * src/aiff.c:
    Changed reading of 'COMM' chunk to avoid reading an int
    which overlaps an int (4 byte) boundary.
