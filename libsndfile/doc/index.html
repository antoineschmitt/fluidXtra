	Libsndfile is a C library for reading and writing files containing sampled sound 
	(such as MS Windows WAV and the Apple/SGI AIFF format) through one standard 
	library interface. It is released in source code format under the 
		<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">Gnu General Public License</A>.
<BR><BR>
	The library was written to compile and run on a Linux system but should compile
	and run on just about any Unix. It now also compiles and runs on Win32 systems
	using the Microsoft compiler (thanks to the efforts of Albert Faber) and MacOS
	using the Metrowerks compiler (thanks to Ben "Jacobs").
<BR><BR>	
	It was designed to handle both little-endian (such as WAV) and big-endian 
	(such as AIFF) data, and to compile and run correctly on little-endian (such and Intel 
	and DEC/Compaq Alpha) processor systems as well as big-endian processor systems such 
	as Motorola 68k, Power PC, MIPS and Sparc. Hopefully the design of the library will 
	also make it easy to extend for reading and writing new sound file formats.
<BR><BR>
    It has so far been compiled and tested on the following systems:
	<UL>
	<LI>i586-pc-linux-gnu (Redhat 5.2 glibc)
	<LI>mips-sgi-irix5.3 (Native IRIX toolset)
	<LI>sparc-sun-solaris2.7 (gcc)
	<LI>sparc-sun-solaris2.5.1 (gcc)
	<LI>mips-sgi-irix5.3 (gcc)
	<LI>mips-sgi-irix6.3 (cc - native compiler)
	<BR>
	<LI>Win32 (Microsoft Visual C++)
	<LI>MacOS 8.6 (Metrowerks Codewarrior Pro4)
	</UL>
<BR>

<A NAME="Capabilities">
<FONT SIZE=+20 COLOR="#5050FF"><BR><B>Capabilities</B></FONT>

<BR><BR>
	libsndfile is currently capable of reading and writing the following sound file
	formats :
	<UL>
	<LI> Microsoft WAV 8, 16, 24 and 32 bit integer PCM.
    <LI> Microsoft 32 bit floating point PCM. 
    <LI> Apple/SGI AIFF and AIFC uncompressed 8, 16, 24 and 32 bit integer PCM. 
    <LI> Sun/NeXT AU/SND format (big endian 8, 16, 24 and 32 bit PCM, 8 bit u-law and 8 bit A-law). 
    <LI> Dec AU format (little endian 8, 16, 24 and 32 bit PCM, 8 bit u-law and 8 bit A-law). 
    <LI> Microsoft IMA/DVI ADPCM WAV format (16 bits per sample compressed to 4 bits per sample). 
    <LI> Microsoft ADPCM WAV format (16 bits per sample compressed to 4 bits per sample). 
    <LI> Microsoft 8 bit A-law an u-law formats (16 bits per sample compressed to 8 bits per sample). 
    <LI> RAW header-less PCM files of 8 (signed and unsigned), 16, 24 and 32 bits. The 16, 24 and 32 
			bit files may be big or little endian byte ordering.
	</UL>
<BR>
	In the near future I hope to add the following to the list:
	<UL>
	<LI> Soundfont II.
	<LI> Gravis Ultrasound patch files.
	<LI> Kurzweil K2000 sampler files.
	<LI> Ensoniq Paris audio file format (.PAF).
	<LI> MPEG Layer 3.
	</UL>
<BR>
	Other file formats may also be added on request.

<FONT SIZE=+20 COLOR="#5050FF"><BR><B>History</B></FONT>

<BR><BR>
	My first attempt at reading and writing WAV files was in 1990 or so under Windows
	3.1. I started using Linux in early 1995 and contributed some code to the 
		<A HREF="http://www.vaxxine.com/ve3wwg/gnuwave.html">wavplay</A>
	program which would eventually mutate into this library. As one of my interests
	is Digital Signal Processing (DSP) I decided that as well as reading data from an
	audio file in the native format (typically 16 bit short integers) it would also 
	be useful to be able to have the library do the conversion to floating point numbers
	for DSP applications. It then dawned on me that whatever file format (anything from
	8 bit unsigned chars, to 32 bit floating point numbers) the library should be able 
	to convert the data to whatever format the library user wishes to use it in. For 
	example, in a sound playback program, the library caller typically wants the sound 
	data in 16 bit short integers to dump into a sound card even though the data in the
	file may be 32 bit floating point numbers (ie Microsoft's WAVE_FORMAT_IEEE_FLOAT 
	format). Another example would be someone doing speech recognition research who has
	recorded some speech as a 16 bit WAV file but wants to process it as double precision 
	floating point numbers.

    Here is the release history for libsndfile :
	<UL>
	<LI>Version 0.0.8 (Feb 15 1999) First official release.
	<LI>Version 0.0.9 (Mar 14 1999) Added support for IMA ADPCM WAV files and
		8 bit PCM AIFF, AU and WAV files.
	<LI>Version 0.0.12 (Jun 19 1999) Added <B>read only</B> support for MS ADPCM WAV files plus
		a number of bug fixes and code cleanups. It now also compiles and runs on Win32 systems.
		using the Microsoft compiler (thanks to the efforts of Albert Faber).
	<LI>Version 0.0.15 (Jul 30 1999) Added ability to write MS ADPCM WAV files. Added WAV and AU
		file A-law and u-law encoding/decoding. Added RAW headerless PCM file handling. It now
		also compiles and runs on MacOS using the Metrowerks compiler (thanks to Ben "Jacobs").
	<LI>Version 0.0.16 (Jul 31 1999) Fixed minor MacOS problems.
